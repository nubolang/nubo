# Nubo configuration file

# Syntax parser configuration
syntax:
  # Lexer allows us to configure the lexer context deadline
  lexer:
    debug:
      enable: "development" # production, development, any
      file: "{nubo_dir}/debug/lexer.yaml" # You can specify "{nubo_dir_full_file}" if you don't want lexer to rewrite the previous file

  # Tokenizer also allows us to configure the tokenizer context deadline
  tokenizer:
    context:
      deadline: 5000 # 5 seconds to tokenize the parsed code
    debug:
      enable: "development" # production, development, any
      file: "{nubo_dir}/debug/ast.yaml" # You can specify "{nubo_dir_full_file}" if you don't want tokenizer to rewrite the previous file

# Nubo runtime configuration
runtime:
  # @server (builtin author, like @std) packages configuration file
  server:
    address: ":3000" # This is the default address that nubo will use to start the server if not specified
    max_concurrency: 50 # This is the maximum number of concurrent requests that nubo will handle
    max_upload_size_byte: 1_000_000 # This is the maximum size of the uploaded data that nubo will handle (in bytes: 1mb)
    max_upload_file_size: 5 # This is the maximum size of the uploaded file that nubo will handle (in megabytes: 5mb)

  # @std (builtin author) packages configuration file
  std:
    allow: ":all" # Allow all packages, or you can specify a list of packages to allow separated by commas, like "hash,http,math"
    disallow: "-" # Disallow packages, use "-" to allow everything, or a list of packages to disallow separated by commas, like "hash,http,math"
    # allow: "-" or disallow: ":all" will disallow every package no matter what are the other values

  # Built-in event configuration
  events:
    enabled: true # Enable or disable event provider
    max_workers_per_topic: 10 # This is the maximum number of workers that nubo will handle per topic
    channel_buffer_size: 1024 # This is the maximum size of the channel buffer that nubo will handle per topic

  # Interpreter configuration
  interpreter:
    import:
      prefix:
        "@nubo/": "@nubolang/" # Use nubo packages with @nubo prefix instead
        "~": "{current_dir}" # ~ can be used as a prefix for the current directory root
        # You can modify this to load files from src instead by "{current_dir}/src"
        # Add as many prefixes as you want
